Git Explaination:
================
First Day i will get the respository access from my lead through mail . After that i will clone the project in my local machine with help of command git clone url . And I  fetch new created branch in local by using git fetch command then i move my control to my branch by git checkout branch name then i push my code with branch by following steps
1. git status --> For tracking untracked file
2. git add . --> For moving all folder
3. git commit -m "Message" --> For Moving our code from Local to Staging area[.git]
4.git push -u origin branch --> For Moving our code from local repository [Staging area .git] to Remore Respository [branch]
After that i want to rise pull request from my branch to master if there is no conflict it will automatically merge suppose if conflict is there i want to resolve conflict by getting updated code of master by using git pull origin master it will reflect in eclipse with head and tail head contain updated copy of branch tail will contain updated copy of master i want to rearrange code and again i want to push my code in branch from my branch i want to rise pull request
